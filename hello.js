// Running JS files:
//  - We can either open the node REPL, by typing node on the terminal, & write/execute JS code, OR
//    we can write JS code inside a file with .js extension & run it by typing node + fileName.js in the terminal

// Ex: create a file called hello.js & write a program that logs a greeting msg to the console.
//     by running node hello.js in the terminal, I should see the msgs in quotes:
console.log("Hello - I am a file!!!!!");

console.log("I'm relearning JS!");

// Ex: Run a JavaScript file that logs the result of 2 + 2 in the console:
let sum = 2 + 2;
console.log(sum);
